# Telco Customer Churn â€” EDA & Modeling

This project walks through the essential stages of data analysis and machine learning to **predict customer churn** for a telecom operator. You will build baseline models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) after auditing, cleaning, and encoding the data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Inspect and understand the dataset (shape, columns, dtypes, missingness).
- Clean and prepare features for modeling.
- Encode categorical variables and create a fully numeric training table.
- Train and evaluate **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** classifiers for churn prediction.
